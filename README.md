# wealth-tax-simulator

This simulator is a project of the World Inequality Lab, aiming at allowing anyone to design their own global wealth tax, and see its downfalls on the region of their choice.

It is hosted at [this page](https://wid.world/world-wealth-tax-simulator/). We encourage you to read the "About" and "Data" sections to know more about its functioning.
